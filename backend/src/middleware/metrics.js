/**
 * src/middleware/metrics.js
 *
 * Per-request HTTP metrics middleware. MUST be mounted after
 * pino-http (so req.log / req.id is available) and before the route
 * handlers (so the histogram observation captures the full request
 * including the handler and any auth work).
 *
 * The `res.on("finish")` hook fires AFTER Express has finalised the
 * response status, which is the only safe point to read res.statusCode.
